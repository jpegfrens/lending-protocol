Notes (e.g. from compound docs):
- Unitroller & Comptroller Implementation: The Comptroller is implemented as an upgradeable proxy. The Unitroller proxies all logic to the Comptroller implementation, but storage values are set on the Unitroller. To call Comptroller functions, use the Comptroller ABI on the Unitroller address.

- Price Oracle
- Interest Rate Model

- FORK token (Token of the protocol)
