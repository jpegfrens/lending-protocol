# Sonne Finance Fork - WIP

## What can I do with this codebase ?

- Just run `npx hardhat node` to start a local Hardhat Network.
- Then (in another terminal) run npx `hardhat run scripts/deploy/local.ts --network localhost`. This will make a full deploy and setup some test users that get a few mock ERC20 token minted, supply that to the protocol, enter markets with their supplied tokens as collateral and borrow against it.

## WIP Notes

Suppling ETH/ERC20:

- When supplying Ether to the Compound protocol, an application can send ETH directly to the payable mint function in the cEther contract. Following that mint, cEther is minted for the wallet or contract that invoked the mint function. Remember that if you are calling this function from another smart contract, that contract needs a payable function in order to receive ETH when you redeem the cTokens later. (https://medium.com/compound-finance/supplying-assets-to-the-compound-protocol-ec2cf5df5aa)
- The operation is slightly different for cERC20 tokens. In order to mint cERC20 tokens, the invoking wallet or contract needs to first call the approve function on the underlying tokenâ€™s contract. All ERC20 token contracts have an approve function.

## Scripts structure

- we have utils for
  - mock token deployment
  - protocol contract deployments
  - test-user setup
    - minting tokens to them
    - supplying tokens to the protocol
    - lending tokens
- we assemble this utils for
  - testnet deployments with
    - mock token deployment
    - protocol contract deployments
    - test-user setup
  - production deployments with
    - protocol contract deployments

- We deploy mock tockens and soTokens for

  - BUSD: 6 Decimals
  - CAKE: 18 Decimals
  - MATIC: 18 Decimals
  - USDC: 6 Decimals
  - AAVE: 18 Decimals
  - DAI: 18 Decimals

- For deployment testing:
  - Fork BSC testnet with `npx hardhat node --fork https://rpc.ankr.com/bsc_testnet_chapel`
  - Run BSC testnet deployment against the local fork `npx hardhat run scripts/deploy/bsc-testnet.ts --network localhost`

## Comments to the Interest Rate Model

- like Sonne we pretend that a block takes 1 second. That especially makes sense on L2s.
- therefore instead of blocks the timestamp is used in CToken
